    "My model shown above is derived from the NVIDIA model. The model includes five convolutional layer and three fully connected layer. Additionally, the model uses RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity, and the data is normalized, resized and cropped in the model using a Keras lambda layer at the begining of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to reduce overfitting, more data sets are collected using the simulator such as counter-clockwise lap and recovery lap. At the same time, all the images from three cameras are used to triain the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained and validated(20% of dataset) on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting . The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Appropriate training data\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road, and reverse driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to test different model from simplest one (such as one layer neural network) to more sophisticated model(NVIDIA Network).\n",
    "\n",
    "My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the LeNet I thought this model might be appropriate because it works well to recognize the German Traffic Sign from previous project. Then I tried more complex architecture derived from NVIDIA Network which is specifically used for the steering angle prediciton of self-driving vehicle. It works much better than LeNet since it has deeper network so that it can capture more detailed information from the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my NIVIDIA model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a relatively high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "To combat the overfitting, I collected more data by using images from three cameras, which reduce the overfitting a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track and there is too much jitter in steering. In order to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I added a low-pass filter for the steering data to get rid of the steering angles which is too big affecting the smoothness of the driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road and it can go back to the center of the road when it is approaching to the side of the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Final Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model architecture (model.py lines 128-136) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes:\n",

    "#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "\n",
    "I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to drive back to center of the road. These images show what a recovery looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image5]\n",
    "![alt text][image6]\n",
    "![alt text][image7]\n",
    "\n",
    "To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would ... For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image1]\n",
    "\n",
    "After the collection process, I had 58122 number of data points. I then preprocessed this data by resizing it from 160x320x3 to 32x32x3 and cropping it to specifically focus on the road area.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 20% of the data into a validation set. \n",
    "\n",
    "I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was 10 as evidenced by the loss plot. I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.\n",
